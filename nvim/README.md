# NVim dotfiles  
  
Use a recent nvim version (I'm running v0.11.4).  

Further ideas I would like to explore, configure, learn:  
* telescope
* auto-session 
* which-key.nvim 
* venv-selector 
* enable/implement simple linting fixes (potentially with copilot?) 
* find/peek/go to source of symbol in new view?
* duplicate current view into new tab
* highlight all instances of symbol under cursor
* folding methods
