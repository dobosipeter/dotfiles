# dotfiles  
  
This repository contains my dotfiles.  
So far I've configured neovim and zsh.  

## Acquisition  
  
Just clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/dobosipeter/dotfiles.git
  
## Usage  
  
I recommend symlinking the files that you'd like to use to the appropriate locations.
